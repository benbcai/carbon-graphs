## Usage

For convenience, there are 2 sets of distributions provided.

-   `lib/js` - [default] Only `core`. Does not contain any dependencies, consumers need to provide the items listed in the `Dependencies` section before loading the graph.
-   `dist/js` - Contains core + `d3` + all the necessary polyfills needed to load the graphs.

Add `dist/js/carbon-graphs.js` and `dist/css/carbon-graphs.css` in your page and call appropriate graph type declarations mentioned in below documentation.

## Install

-   `npm install`
-   `npm run dev`
